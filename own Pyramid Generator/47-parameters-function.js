// When you have a value that is explicitly written in your code, like the "Hello!" string in your function, it is considered to be hard-coded. Hard-coding a value inside a function might not make it as reusable as you'd like.

// Instead, you can define parameters for the function. Parameters are special variables that are given a value when you call the function, and can be used in your function to dynamically change the result of the function's code.

// To add a parameter to your function, you need to add a variable name inside the parentheses. For example, this demo function has a name parameter:

// function demo(name) {

// }
// name sounds like a useful parameter, so go ahead and add it to your padRow function.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

function padRow(name) {
  return "Hello!";
}
const call = padRow();
console.log(call);


for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
