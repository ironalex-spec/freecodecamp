// Were you expecting to see 4 in the console? .push() returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.

// It is important to be aware of what values a method returns. Take some time to experiment with .push() and .pop(). When you are ready, remove all of your .push() and .pop() calls, and your console.log statements.

// let character = 'Hello';
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// let pushed = rows.push(100);
// console.log(pushed);
// console.log(rows);

let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
