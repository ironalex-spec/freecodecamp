// Your loop now needs a proper iterator. The iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your for loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.

// It is a common convention to use i as your iterator variable in a loop. A for loop allows you to declare this in the parentheses (). For example, here is a for loop that declares an index variable and assigns it the value 100.

// for (let index = 100; "second"; "third") {

// }
// Replace the string "iterator" with a let declaration for the variable i. Assign it the value 0 to start. This will give the i variable the value 0 the first time your loop runs.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
for (let i = 0; "condition"; "iteration") {

}
