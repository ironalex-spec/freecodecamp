// A function call allows you to actually use a function. You may not have been aware of it, but the methods like .push() that you have been using have been function calls.

// A function is called by referencing the function's name, and adding (). Here's how to call a test function:

// test();
// Replace the character.repeat(i + 1) in your .push() call with a function call for your padRow function.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return character.repeat(rowNumber);
}


for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(padRow())
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
