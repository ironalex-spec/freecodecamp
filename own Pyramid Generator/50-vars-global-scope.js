// Variables in JavaScript are available in a specific scope. In other words, where a variable is declared determines where in your code it can be used.

// The first scope is the global scope. Variables that are declared outside of any "block" like a function or for loop are in the global scope. Your character, count, and rows variables are all in the global scope.

// When a variable is in the global scope, a function can access it in its definition. Here is an example of a function using a global title variable:

// const title = "Professor ";
// function demo(name) {
//   return title + name;
// }
// demo("Naomi")
// This example would return "Professor Naomi". Update your padRow function to return the value of concatenating your character variable to the beginning of the name parameter.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

function padRow(name) {
  return character + name;
}
const call = padRow("CamperChan");
console.log(call);


for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
