<!-- In this project, you'll learn to create a calorie counter form that enables users to input their daily calorie budget and the calorie counts of various meals. The form will then calculate and display whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.

You have been provided with boilerplate CSS and HTML. However, you need to build your calorie counter form.

Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS, then add a form element and give it an id set to calorie-counter. -->
