// Because you are only increasing i by 1, you can use the increment operator ++. This operator increases the value of a variable by 1, updating the assignment for that variable. For example, test would become 8 here:

// let test = 7;
// test++;
// Replace your addition assignment with the increment operator for your loop iteration.
