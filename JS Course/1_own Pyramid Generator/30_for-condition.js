// The condition of a for loop tells the loop how many times it should iterate. When the condition becomes false, the loop will stop.

// In JavaScript, a Boolean value can be either true or false. These are not strings - you will learn more about the difference later on.

// For now, you will use the less than operator (<). This allows you to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. For example, count < 3 would evaluate to true if count is 2, and false if count is 4.

// Replace your "condition" string with a condition to check if i is less than count.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; "iteration") {

}
