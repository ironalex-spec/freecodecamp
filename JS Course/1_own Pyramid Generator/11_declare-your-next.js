// You are now ready to declare your next variable. Remove both console.log statements, and the character reassignment.

// Also remove your secondCharacter variable, but leave the character initialization unchanged.

// let character = 'Hello';
// console.log(character);
// character = "World";
// let secondCharacter;
// secondCharacter = character;
// console.log(secondCharacter);

//Solution
let character = 'Hello';
