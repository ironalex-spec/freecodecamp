// There is a bit of a problem, here. Your test declaration is currently after your return statement. An important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your function code. This means that any code after a return statement will not run.

// Move your test initialization to the line above your return statement.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

function padRow(name) {
  const test = "Testing";
  return character + name;
}

const call = padRow("CamperChan");
console.log(call);


for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
