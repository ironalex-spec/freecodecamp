// In the game, there will be multiple rounds. The first to reach three points wins the game.

// In this step, you will focus on determining if the player has won the round.

// Complete the hasPlayerWonTheRound function. This function has two parameters: player and computer. The function should return true if the player has won the round, and false if the player has lost or tied the round.

// Here are the criteria for the player to win a round:

// If the player chooses "Rock" and the computer chooses "Scissors"
// If the player chooses "Scissors" and the computer chooses "Paper"
// If the player chooses "Paper" and the computer chooses "Rock"
// A few function calls have been provided for you to test your function.
