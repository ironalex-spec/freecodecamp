// The map() method is used to iterate through an array and return a new array. It's helpful when you want to create a new array based on the values of an existing array. For example:

// const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
// const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => number * 2); // doubledNumbers will be [2, 4, 6]
// Notice that the map() method takes a function as an argument. This is called a 
//callback function
//, which is a function that is passed to another function as an argument. In the example above, the callback function is (number) => number * 2, and it's run on each element in the numbers array. The map() method then returns a new array with the results.

// Pass in a callback function to the map() method. The callback function should take song as a parameter, use the arrow function syntax, and have an empty body.
