// If you check closely, you'd see the currently playing song is not highlighted in the playlist, so you don't really know which song is playing. You can fix this by creating a function to highlight any song that is being played.

// Using an arrow syntax, create a highlightCurrentSong function. Inside the function, use querySelectorAll to get the .playlist-song element and assign to a playlistSongElements constant.
