// In this project you will learn basic string and array methods by building a music player app. You will be able to play, pause, skip, and shuffle songs.

// The HTML and CSS of this project have been provided for you, so you can focus on the JavaScript.

// Start by accessing the #playlist-songs, #play, and #pause elements with the getElementById() method. Assign them to variables playlistSongs, playButton and pauseButton respectively.

let playlistSongs = document.getElementById("playlist-songs");
let playButton  = document.getElementById("play");
let pauseButton  = document.getElementById("pause");
